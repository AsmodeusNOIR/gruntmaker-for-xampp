GruntMaker for XAMPP v2.0
=========================

Thank you for purchasing the GRUNTMAKER9000.

In this helpful guide, you will learn how to run the software, use the software, FEEL the software.


PRE-INSTRUCTIONS - VERY IMPORTANT:
----------------------------------

You **_must_** have Node.js and XAMPP install prior to this being run.

You _will_ need Ruby and Sass installed before you complete stage 6.

You _will_ need the Grunt CLI and Bower installed via Command Line before you can complete stage 6.

To do this, in your cmd.exe, enter:

| **npm install -g grunt-cli** |
----------------------------
| **npm install -g bower** |


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------

> **STAGE 1)** Unzip all of this into a folder. You may think "Why, that's silly, why would I forget something as simple as that?", but I've seen it done. YOU WEREN'T THERE MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

***

> **STAGE 2)** Run GRUNTMAKER9000. (No, that's it for this stage).

***

> **STAGE 3)** Enter the root folder of your site.<br>
> **[Example]**: Enter 'test01' and it will search for that folder within c:/xampp/htdocs/, if the folder doesn't exist GruntMaker will create the folder. It will still work if you ask it to use an existing folder. (Useful for adding a new theme to an existing site).

***

> **STAGE 4)** Enter the name you want your project to be called. (Also gets used for the Theme & Theme Folder name).

***

> **STAGE 5)** Leave it alone until it tells you it's done. Leave it. Leeeeaaaaave it.

***

> **STAGE 6)** Within your new Theme folder, Right-Click and open your Command Line. 
Here you will enter the GodMode code: "npm install && bower install" which will pleasantly install everything we've already decided we need. At this point, YOU WILL NEED RUBY & SASS INSTALLED.

***

> **STAGE 7)** GRUNT AWAY TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT, MY CHILD, FOR THE GRUNT HATH BEEN MAKETH'D.

***

**_The End._**
