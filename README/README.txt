Thank you for purchasing the GRUNTMAKER9000.

In this helpful guide, you will learn how to run the software, use the software, FEEL the software.


PRE-INSTRUCTIONS - VERY IMPORTANT:
----------------------------------
You must have Node.js and XAMPP install prior to this being run.

You will need Ruby and Sass installed before you complete stage 8.

You will need the Grunt CLI and Bower installed via Command Line before you can complete stage 8.

To do this, in your cmd.exe, enter:

'npm install -g grunt-cli'

'npm install -g bower'

Send a request to Network to have them allow Dev Database permissions for this project.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------

STAGE 1) Unzip all of this into a folder. You may think "Why, that's silly, why would I forget something as simple as that?", but I've seen it done. YOU WEREN'T THERE MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. (No naming names, Mario).

STAGE 2) Run GRUNTMAKER9000. (No, that's it for this stage).

STAGE 3) Enter the root folder of your site.

[Example]: Enter 'test01' and it will search for that folder within c:/xampp/htdocs/, if the folder doesn't exist GruntMaker will create the folder. It will still work if you ask it to use an existing folder. (Useful for adding a new theme to an existing site).

STAGE 4) Enter the name you want your project to be called. (Also gets used for the Theme folder name).

STAGE 5) Leave it alone until it tells you it's done. Leave it. Leeeeaaaaave it.

[SKIP STAGE 6 & 7 IF YOU'RE ONLY ADDING A NEW THEME TO A PRE-EXISTING PROJECT].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 6) If this is an entirely new project, download the entire contents of your Dev Wordpress to the newly created Project folder in c:\xampp\htdocs MAKING SURE THAT YOU DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DOWNLOAD THE .HTACCESS FILE. DON'T DO IT. DON'T. JUST DON'T.

STAGE 7) Edit your wp-config.php file to have multimedia.bip as your DB_HOST, then http://localhost/<Project Name> as your WP_HOME and WP_URL. (If you followed the Pre-Instructions, you'll have permissions alrady set up).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STAGE 8) Within your new Theme folder, Right-Click and open your Command Line. 
Here you will enter the GodMode code: "npm install && bower install" which will pleasantly install everything we've already decided we need. At this point, YOU WILL NEED RUBY & SASS INSTALLED.

STAGE 9) GRUNT AWAY TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT, MY CHILD, FOR THE GRUNT HATH BEEN MAKETH'D.
